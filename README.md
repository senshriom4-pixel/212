# <212>

## 📘 Project Description
The **<212>** smart contract is a minimal Solidity-based project designed to demonstrate basic state management on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities to store values, retrieve them, and manage owner-specific messages. This project serves as a clean template for beginners learning smart contract development.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a foundation for simple blockchain-based data storage and owner-controlled state updates. The project aims to be lightweight, easy to understand, and suitable for expanding into more advanced decentralized applications.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Value Storage:** Store and update a numerical value on-chain.
- **Value Retrieval:** Publicly accessible read-only function to fetch stored values.
- **Owner-Based Message:** Contract owner can set or update a custom message.
- **Ownership Control:** Ensures secure access for owner-only actions.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add event emitters for better transparency.
- Implement access-control modules (e.g., multi-owner or role-based permissions).
- Integrate with front-end UI for user interaction.
- Add data persistence history using arrays or mappings.
- Expand into a template for CRUD-based smart contract applications.
